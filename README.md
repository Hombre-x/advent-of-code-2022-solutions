## Solutions of the Advent of Code 2022 written in Scala 3 with the help of Cats Effect and Fs2.


### How to run it?

In the following path `./src/main/resources/inputs`, add your inputs in your favourite UTF-8 format (I recommend .txt) 
with the name `dayx.txt`, where `x` is a day from 1 to 25:

```
â”œâ”€â”€â”€src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€main
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€resources
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€inputs      <---- right here
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€outputs
```

Then just run the Main.scala file and the solutions should appear both in the console and in the output folder from above.

**Things to do:**
- Automatically retrieve the inputs from the Advent of Code page.
- Do all the exercises this time, not like last year ðŸ™„.
